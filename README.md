Web Design 4 EveryOne Capstone Project
This is the optional week 5 demo of a responsive web site that validates.
The navigation bar builds on the Advance styling for Responsive Design course. 
    The xs and sm viewports have the hamburger icon for the links.
    
There are 4 pages including the home page.
  A final portfolio will develop something beyond the current single image.
Magical Music page which is intended for further html/css exploration for final portfolio but contains 3 memes as placeholders.
Moons and Beyond has a photo carousel of planets along with a table.
Contact Us, Login and Sign Up nav bar links all direct the user to the Contact Us page.
    Currently only a single form to demo the JavaScript to validate fields, it will also
    be developed into something more for portfolio use.

BootStrap is used to implement responsive views. A Media Query was added to the CSS file
to change the background color and simplify the header element. This is intended for the
responsive requirement. A final portfolio website will look different.

I used bright colors to make changes easy to discern and also to please me.
Some images are local to this repository. Some are the property of NASA.
